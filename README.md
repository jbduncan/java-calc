Notice
================
This project is inactive. I've decided to keep it on GitHub to demonstrate what sort of programming skills I had during my first and second years at university.

JCalculator
================
JCalculator is a desktop calculator program written in Java.

Please note this project is in a pre-alpha development stage. I am still learning how to best use Java practices to improve this program, so it is by no means guaranteed to be bug-free.

Licence
================
JCalculator is distributed under the permissive MIT licence. Please see LICENCE.txt for more details.

Acknowledgements
================
I would like to thank Eric Laroche (laroche@lrdev.com) for his Java implementation of an unlimited-size rational number (BigRational.java), which I use in this program.
