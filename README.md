Java Calculator
=========

A Java desktop calculator.

This is a personal project of mine I started in the summer of 2013 before my 2nd year at university.

Development
=========

The IDE used to create java-calc is Eclipse with the WindowBuilder Pro plugin.

This is by no means a finished piece of work - it is neither feature complete nor guaranteed to be bug-free.
